# layerzero_merkly_sybil
The repository is used to verify malicious use of merkly, launch layerzero's witch attack, and partially verify witch addresses  
  
1、The analysis covers most of the major EVM chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Zksync, Linea, Scorll, blast, Mode, Avax, Bnb, Moonbeam, Opbnb, Moonriver;  
  
2、The analysis determines address witches by:  
    *Used merkly;  
    *The total tx number of wallet addresses in these chains;  
    *The total gas balance of the wallet address in these chains;  
    *The creation age of the wallet address;  
    *How many chains are used in the wallet address;  
    *Whether the last transaction and the first transaction of the wallet address are more than 3 months ago or whether they have been used more than 21 times.  
      
3、Specific decision Decision address witch rules:  
    1. First of all, due to conditions, we can only scan polygon blocks in merkly to obtain potential addresses;  
    2. Then use getAddressAge to obtain whether the initial creation date of the user address is >1 year;  
    3, if the user's date <=1 year, the total tx of the user in these chains <200 and the chain used <=2, and then determine the user's total balance gas<10 is a potential witch;   
    If the user's date is >1 year, then the user's total tx in these chains is <300 and the chain used is <=3, and then the user's total balance gas<10 is a potential witch;  
    4. Due to the limited data returned, sybilAddress, a suspect address group, was generated by using the for loop to push the potential witch address to the waitAddress(page).csv   
    file of each data page;  
    5. Then call aggregatedCsv through judge.js to integrate the potential witch address group into the AggregatedWaitSybilGroup file;  
    6, through getTransactionService to find out whether the user's latest transaction > the first transaction three months;  
    7. Run getUserActiveDays to obtain the active days of polygon's address.  
    8. When the last transaction of the potential witch address read is <=3 months away from the first transaction or the active days in polygon are <=21 days, then it is screened  
    whether it is one of the more than 80 w addresses published by layerzero, and determines whether the addresses are repeated, and finally generates the witch list sybilData.csv
